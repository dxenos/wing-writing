I want to write about Wing Chun for three reasons.

First, from a selfish point of view, writing about Wing Chun will crystallize my understanding of the system.

Second, I want to share ideas that might not be mainstream but have been tested, showing benefits in every aspect of my life and in the lives of other practitioners. There is so much bullshit out there.

Third, I want to challenge myself to write something useful consistently and engagingly. 

Finally, for every thousand incorrect interpretations of Wing Chun, we need at least one that makes sense.

I am aware of my ignorance, my limitations, and my biases, but I promise to continually evolve my thinking through experimentation, reflection, and study. The ideas I share will develop over time, and my future self may disagree with my current self. That's a good thing.

I have been practicing and studying Wing Chun for quite some time. I was fortunate to learn from incredible people who studied under Ip Man. This does not matter much, what I learnt is not IP Man's Wing Chun but my interpreation of the Wing Chun that has been passed to his students. 

I have applied what I've learned from Wing Chun hundreds of times, almost every day I use principles from this beautiful system that never stops to fascinate me. 

Yet, I still feel like a beginner. I'm amazed at how deep one can go within Wing Chun. I believe it's no accident that Wing Chun translates to "everlasting spring."
