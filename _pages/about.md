# About Me

I have been practicing and studying Wing Chun for quite some time. I was fortunate to learn from incredible people who studied under Ip Man. This does not matter much, what I learnt is not IP Man's Wing Chun but my interpreation of the Wing Chun that has been passed to his students.

I have applied what I've learned from Wing Chun hundreds of times, almost every day I use principles from this beautiful system that never stops to fascinate me.

# Wing Chun is a wonderful system that is severely misunderstood...

The purpose of this place is to publish, reflections, findings, and lessons from researching and practicing Wing Chun. 

I hope this place would help practitioners to understand Wing Chun deeper, and it would also help them to assess their path and make adjustments to accelerate their progress and understanding.
